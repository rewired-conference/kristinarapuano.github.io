<b>I'm currently a postdoc</b> in the [FAB lab](http://fablab.yale.edu/) working with [BJ Casey](https://psychology.yale.edu/people/bj-casey). Before this, I completed my PhD at Dartmouth College in the [COSAN lab](http://cosanlab.com/) with [Luke Chang](http://lukejchang.com/).

<b>I'm interested in</b> understanding why some individuals are more at vulnerable than others to health-risk outcomes (e.g., obesity, addiction). You can read more about my research [here](https://kristinarapuano.github.io/research/)!

<b>I'm also a strong advocate</b> for increasing the visibility of women in STEM. I plan to include more on this topic in [blog-form](https://kristinarapuano.github.io/year-archive/), but for now you can follow my rants on [twitter](https://twitter.com/kristinarapuano).
